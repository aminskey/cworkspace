You know the extended ascii characters you can draw with in terminal
it's possible for Mac.

    How?
        well you just enter terminal press Cmd+ ','
        and you go to the settings:
            in the profile section click 'advanced' and there you will see what encoding set your terminal uses.
            change it to Western Dos latin 1
        if it's not there go to the Encoding section and select it..
