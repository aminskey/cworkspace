# The C-Workspace
This workspace contains programs, both new and old.    
I started learning C through    
_The C Programming Language    
**The Second Edition**_    
    
And it had many challenges, but later on I started making my own experiments.    
Just like the WinSh desktop.    
Ncurses-Desktop is just an improved version of the WinSh.    
The Instructions on building and installing the programs are in the Ncurses-Desktop repo.
