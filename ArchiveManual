This is a manual for Archive.

When using Archive You should have a directory called .archive in your home directory, or else Archive wont be able to find your requested files.

How search files:

Archive will only find files in the .archive directory.

If you want to exit; write end so that the File serving system will close (Aka 'Local File Server')

That's it
